# IMPORTANT: Order matters! More specific rules come first
# Serve _next static assets normally (no redirect needed - files exist)
# Netlify automatically serves existing files, so we just need to handle non-file routes

# Redirect all non-file routes to index.html for SPA routing
# Netlify will serve existing files (_next/*, images/*) automatically

# Note: No Next.js plugin needed for static export
# Static export generates proper HTML files that Netlify can serve directly
